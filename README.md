# hello-world
A small Hello, World! in order to become more familiar with GitHub.

/* This is me telling you about me, I myself find that a bit weird, for you is in fact me. */

/* I am trying to learn to program. This is something I have tried many times in the past, but
  I never stuck with it. Now seems different. I have started working with Arduino and this has
  gotten me going. I have to admit, it isn't easy to keep going. It is difficult finding a 
  lesson series/tutorial that follows my learning curve. Luckily I have a pair of friends who
  are programmers (and then some) and who are helping me out, by letting me learn the way I 
  learn best. I hope to keep this up for quite some time to come. ~ Brave Tea */
